# My second JavaScript Project

This site is a landing page that offers meal plan services. The page contains tabs with information, sliders, a discount action timer and a calorie calculator. A potential user will be able to fill out an order in a form in a modal window. For convenience, it appears independently after a certain time has passed, but if he has already opened it before that moment, the timer will not work. This takes care of the user, freeing him from intrusive windows.

# What I've learned

* Work with Git & GitHub
* Work with Babel & Webpack
* Split the application into components
* Transfer data from forms to a PHP file
* Creat timers
* Work with modals
* & other.

# Features

1. The information is provided in a convenient format, in the form of sliders, tabs or pop-ups. Thanks to this, they do not clog the page.
2. The ability to calculate your calorie allowance based on height, weight and age.
3. Calculation of the cost of the service at a certain rate.
